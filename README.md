# Libft
Libft is the first project done in 42 MÃ¡laga, which I validated on 18th December 2023. It includes several general use functions, as well as the header file and a Makefile that will compile everything. You can find the subject <a href="https://github.com/rphlr/42-Subjects/blob/main/common-core/libft/en.subject.pdf">here</a>. This library will be very useful in many other projects for 42; in fact I have used it in virtually all the other projects until the date when I'm writing this.

<h3>Things to improve:</h3>
Might be interesting if I checked everything and tried to make it as code-efficient as possible.
